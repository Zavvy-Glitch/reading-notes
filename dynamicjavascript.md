# Lesson 6: Dynamic JavaScript

## JavaScript Variables
    
    Variables = Containers for Storing Data Values
    Example:
        - var r = 20;
        - var x = 15;
        - var u = 17
        - so on and so forth.
    This will read as:
        - variable r will store the value of 20
        - variable x will store the value of 15
        - variable u will store the value of 17
        -etc.

    By using the keyword var, we are able to make computations similar to that of algebra
    Example: (without the word let)
        let: var cost1 = 16;
        let: var cost2 = 200;
        let: var total = cost1 + cost2;      

        This should compute out to be 216

        Notice that the variables cost1 and cost2 have different names. In order for this to execute your variabels will require unique names. Those are known as identifiers.
         - cost1 is and identifier same as cost 2

## Assignment Operators
    Assignment operators are identified by an (=) symbol.
    *NOTE: THIS DOES NOT MEAN EQUAL. Think of it more of as a replacement.
        Example:
             x = 34 + x
             This will read out as the value of 34 + x will be assigned to  x
             This means the value of x will increase by increments of 34

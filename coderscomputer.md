## Options that are prebuilt into many computers

Windows | Mac       | Linux |
------- | --------- | ----- |
NotePad | Text Edit | Variable |

However, these editors have several draw backs. Coding will practically be full on free hand. Some prefer it as such, my self? Not so much
With the continual changes and added features to coding, keeping up with the jones' on such a platform may get quite tiresome.

## Cheat Sheet

Opening Terminals:
 * MAC Users: Applications > Utilities
 * Linux: Applications > System or Applications > Utilities
 * Windows: SSH Client for remote login

Commands | Meaning |
-------- | ------- |
pwd | Print Working Directory |
ls | Abbreviation for list |
ls -a | Contents of Directory, including hidden files. |
cd | change directory |
file[path] | file location with in system |


### Types of Paths
* Absolute: identifiable by forward slash's (/). Specifies location in congruency to root directory.
* Relative: identifiable as there isn't a slash. Specifies location in congruency to where you are in your system.

### Things to Remember

- Linux is Case Sensitive
- Spaces in names will create separate items ie: monkey puzzle > mkdir monkey puzzle > will create one file for monkey and one for puzzle
- Quotes 'monkey puzzle' > Will allow for the file name to have a space. This is also the same with a backslash: monkey\ puzzle.

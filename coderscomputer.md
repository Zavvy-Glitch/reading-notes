# The Computer's Coder

Essentially, the author of this excerpt explains that, which ever text editor you choose is up to you. Dependent upon your stylings in regards to items such as:
 - Syntax Highlighting
 - Extensions
 - Code Completions
 - Variable Themes to help with eye straining
 - etc.

## Options that are prebuilt into many computers

Windows | Mac       | Linux |
------- | --------- | ----- |
NotePad | Text Edit | Variable |

However, these editors have several draw backs. Coding will practically be full on free hand. Some prefer it as such, my self? Not so much
With the continual changes and added features to coding, keeping up with the jones' on such a platform may get quite tiresome.

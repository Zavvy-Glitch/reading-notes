# Reading Notes for CodeFellows

Reading Notes Repo to track reading notes

## About Me

I am a 10 year Air Force Veteran where I was a C-17 Globemaster airframe mechanic. The job itself was heavily labor intensive, but it had amazing perks. Flights around the world? ***Check.*** Life long lessons in understanding your limits? ***Absolutely.*** Gaining copious amounts of real world experience that can be utilized extensively? ***They've got you covered***, and mind you, you had to learn quick.

In August of 2019 I finially decided to exit the military and pursue my own educational goals. I attempted to attend a community college for several years. That ultimately didn't work out. So, here I am, attending CodeFellows to pursue a dream of becoming a Software Developer.

I'm currently working as an Operations Manager for UPS. I have been with them for the last 3 years. I am originally from St. Paul, MN. I have been living in Seattle for the last 4 years, however I've been in WA as a whole for the last 13.  I have some hobbies such as:


| Odd Hobbies | Normal Hobbies |
| :---------: | :------------: |
| Collecting Rocks | Snowboarding |
| Mushroom Hunting | Painting |
| Cat Obsessions | Botany |


## Growth Mindset
- It's ***never too late*** to start over. It's proven teaching an old dog new tricks is possible.
  - Take notes.
  - Review them.
  - Ask as many questions you need.
- Reading is Fundamental. ***Google counts!*** (HAHA)
- ***Believe in the process.*** Above all else, ***believe in yourself!***

>Remember, every one of us are like trees. No matter how far up we branch, there are roots that keep us steady and grounded. Make sure to build your foundation. Feed it. Water it. Noursh it.

### To Me Growth Mindset is About:
Perserverance. No matter how difficult the daily tasks may be, remember that there is either someone there to help out or there is always a way to find more information. It'll take initiative and drive to reach your finish line. Whether that finish line be one that is to end months from now; possibly years, even a daily finish line push through. A growth mindset is one that is always striving to absorb the information of subjects we enjoy. A continuation of education. At many times it's also absorbing information on things we don't enjoy.

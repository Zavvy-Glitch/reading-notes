## About Me

I am a 10 year Air Force Veteran exiting the military back in 2019.


## Growth Mindset
- It's ***never too late*** to start over. It's proven teaching an old dog new tricks is possible.
  - Take notes.
  - Review them.
  - Ask as many questions you need.
- Reading is Fundamental. ***Google counts!*** (HAHA)
- ***Believe in the process.*** Above all else, ***believe in yourself!***

>Remember, every one of us are like trees. No matter how far up we branch, there are roots that keep us steady and grounded. Make sure to build your foundation. Feed it. Water it. Noursh it.

### To Me Growth Mindset is About:
Perserverance.

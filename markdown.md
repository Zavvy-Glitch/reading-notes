# Reading Notes for CodeFellows

Reading Notes Repo to track reading notes

What I've learned so far. Markdown is similar to that of HTML. However,  it would seem it is more simplistic in how it utilizes code. For example: Headers.
Headers are written with octothorps. Also known to my generation and younger as **HASHTAGS**. :rofl:

Typing out a variable number of octothorps will allow you to select a heading size. There are 6 in total.

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 | Header 5 | Header 6 |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| #        | ##       | ###      | ####     | #####    | ######   |

Below here is how they will generate:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header  4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

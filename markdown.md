# Lesson 1: Markdown

What I've learned so far. Markdown is similar to that of HTML. However,  it would seem it is more simplistic in how it utilizes code. For example: Headers.

Headers are written with octothorps. Also known to my generation and younger as **HASHTAGS**. :rofl:




Typing out a variable number of octothorps will allow you to select a heading size. There are 6 in total.




| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 | Header 5 | Header 6 |

| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |

| #        | ##       | ###      | ####     | #####    | ######   |




Below here is how they will generate:




# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header  4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6

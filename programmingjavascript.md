# Lesson 7: Programming with JavaScript

## Expressions and Operators

### Operators

 Javascript has several operators:

 | Assignment Operators | Comparison Operators | Arithmetic operators |
 | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: |
 | Bitwise operators | Logical operators | String operators |
 | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :----------------: |
 | Conditional (ternary) operator | Comma operator | Unary operators |
 | :-----------------------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: |
 | Relational operators |

    JavaScript will have both BINARY  and UNARY operators, and a special TERNARY operator (conditional)

    Binary Operators:
        -Will have and operand before and after the operator

            Example:
                - 80+14 or x-y ------- OR being the operator and operand of 80+14 and x-y to the sides of it.

    Unary Operators:
        -Will only have a single operand before or after the operator

            Example:
            - y++ or ++y ------- x being the operator and ++ being the operand or ++ being the operand and y being the operator

 | Compound assignment operators |
 | Name | Shorthand operator | Meaning |
 | Assignment | x = y | x = y |
 | Addition assignment| x += y | x = x + y |
 | Subtraction assignment | x -= y | x = x - y |
 | Multiplication assignment | x *= y | x = x* y |
 | Division assignment | x /= y | x = x / y |

### Functions

 Functions are  fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.

    Functions are similar to procedures. You create a set of statements that performs tasks or calculates a specific value.
    In order for it to be a function, in needs an input and it must return an output.

  Function definition AKA: function declaration, or function statement, consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        - Name of the function.
        - A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
        - Statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}. "

    Example:
        function *this is the declaration* unique *name of function* (parameters, go, here) *parameters go inside parenthesis separate with commas if multiple* { return parameter * parameter;
        }

        Lets make it easier to read:
        
        function unique (help) {
            return help * help;
        } 
        (This is not an actual function)

        This would be read as function unique uses one parameter, we named it help. There is only one singular statement that tells it to return the parameter of the function (help) multiplied by itself. In which we should get a return of help * help.

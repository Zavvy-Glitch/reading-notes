# Lesson 7: Programming with JavaScript

## Expressions and Operators

### Operators

 Javascript has several operators:

 | Assignment Operators | Comparison Operators | Arithmetic operators |
 | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: |
 | Bitwise operators | Logical operators | String operators |
 | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :----------------: |
 | Conditional (ternary) operator | Comma operator | Unary operators |
 | :-----------------------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: |
 | Relational operators |

    JavaScript will have both BINARY  and UNARY operators, and a special TERNARY operator (conditional)

    Binary Operators:
        -Will have and operand before and after the operator

            Example:
                - 80+14 or x-y ------- OR being the operator and operand of 80+14 and x-y to the sides of it.

    Unary Operators:
        -Will only have a single operand before or after the operator

            Example:
            - y++ or ++y ------- x being the operator and ++ being the operand or ++ being the operand and y being the operator

 | Compound assignment operators |
 | Name | Shorthand operator | Meaning |
 | Assignment | x = y | x = y |
 | Addition assignment| x += y | x = x + y |
 | Subtraction assignment | x -= y | x = x - y |
 | Multiplication assignment | x *= y | x = x * y |
 | Division assignment | x /= y | x = x / y |
 | Remainder assignment	x %= y	x = x % y
 | Exponentiation assignment	x **= y	x = x ** y
 | Left shift assignment	x <<= y	x = x << y
 | Right shift assignment	x >>= y	x = x >> y
 | Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= y	x = x >>> y
 | Bitwise AND assignment	x &= y	x = x & y
 | Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= y	x = x ^ y
 | Bitwise OR assignment	x |= y	x = x | y
 | Logical AND assignment	x &&= y	x && (x = y)
 | Logical OR assignment	x ||= y	x || (x = y)
 | Logical nullish assignment	x ??= y	x ?? (x = y)

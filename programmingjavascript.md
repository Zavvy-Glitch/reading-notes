# Lesson 7: Programming with JavaScript

## Expressions and Operators

### Operators

Javascript has several operators:

| Assignment Operators | Comparison Operators | Arithmetic operators |
| :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: |
| Bitwise operators | Logical operators | String operators |
| :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :----------------: |
| Conditional (ternary) operator | Comma operator | Unary operators |
| :-----------------------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: |
| Relational operators |

JavaScript will have both BINARY  and UNARY operators, and a special TERNARY operator (conditional)

Binary Operators:
    -Will have and operand before and after the operator

        Example:
            - 80+14 or x-y ------- OR being the operator and operand of 80+14 and x-y to the sides of it.

Unary Operators:
    -Will only have a single operand before or after the operator

        Example:
            - y++ or ++y ------- x being the operator and ++ being the operand or ++ being the operand and y being the operator

# Lesson 8: Operators and Loops

## Loops
    
    Loops offer quick and easy ways to repetitively do something.
    Kinds of loop statments:
        - for
        - do
        - while
        - labeled
        - break
        - continue
        - for... in
        - for... of

    for Statement - this will loop repetitively until a specific condition gives a false return.
        Example:
            - for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
                statement
    do...while Statement - same as above repeats until specific  condition evaluates to false.
        Example:
            - do
                statement
            while (condition);
    while Statement - executes statements as long as specified condition evaluates to true. If condition returns false it will stop.
        Example:
            - let n = 0;
              let x = 0;
              while (n < 3) {
                n++;
                x += n;
            }

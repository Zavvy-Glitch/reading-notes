# Reading 4: HTML

# HTML BASICS

#### Hypertext Markup Language

What is it?
- Code used to structure a webpage & contents.
- It is a markup language that constists of a series of **elements**

#### Anatomy of HTML:
- Opening Tags: <  > within these angled brackets would be an element. It will generate varying commands for your content.
- Closing Tags: </ > same as opeing, but it has a forward slash. Just as it states it will close the command for the content within.
- Content: This is just the text in or visual in which you want specifically displayed in a certain fashion.
- Element: the command inside the angled brackets

#### Semantics:

For programmers this pertains to the purpose of an element.
For example: h1 within the angled brackets < >? Whats the purpose of the h1. It is intended to make the content within look like a header.
